GooDrive
========

GooDrive is trying to be the most functional Google Drive Client available today for linux. I'm an amateur programmer 
and i believe i've learnt a lot while coding this application. We already have few Google Drive client programs([Grive](https://github.com/Grive/grive), [Grive2](https://github.com/vitalif/grive2), [GoogleDriveJavaClient] (https://github.com/edgefox/GoogleDriveJavaClient)) written 
for linux by great programmers and they definitely inspired me a lot. The reason i started this project is, I found that existing Google Drive clients lack key 
features and those are not supported by the developers recently and also it is very unlikely to see an official version 
of Google Drive client on linux any time soon.

Like i said, I wanted it to be most functional rather than most efficient for now. So i will be tweaking up the code
constantly to improve efficiency. This can be considered as a "functional prototype rather than considering as a beta
version".

Feature Supported:
